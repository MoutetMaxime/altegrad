## Course Overview
The ALTEGRAD course dives deep into advanced AI methods designed to handle and process complex data types, specifically textual and graph-based data. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with cutting-edge models and algorithms used in these fields.

## Lab Sessions

### Lab1 - Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN)
In this session, we explore Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN), a model designed for document classification that takes into account the hierarchical structure of documents (words, sentences) and applies attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant parts of the text.

- **Goal:** Implement and experiment with HANs for text classification tasks.
- **Key Topics:** Hierarchical architecture, word/sentence-level attention, document classification.

### Future Labs
Further TPs will cover other advanced AI topics for text and graph data.
