# ALTEGRAD - Advanced AI for Texts and Graphs Data

This repository contains the lab sessions for the ALTEGRAD course, taught by M. Vazirgiannis. The course covers advanced techniques in artificial intelligence applied to text and graph data. Each lab session focuses on a specific topic related to these themes.

## Course Overview
The ALTEGRAD course dives deep into advanced AI methods designed to handle and process complex data types, specifically textual and graph-based data. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with cutting-edge models and algorithms used in these fields.

## Lab Sessions

### Lab1 - Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN)
In this session, we explore Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN), a model designed for document classification that takes into account the hierarchical structure of documents (words, sentences) and applies attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant parts of the text.

- **Goal:** Implement and experiment with HANs for text classification tasks.
- **Key Topics:** Hierarchical architecture, word/sentence-level attention, document classification.

### Lab2 - Transfer Learning for NLP
In this session, we explore the transformer (encoder only) architecture. We construct our model with a base transformer model, and a classification head, which is used to pretrain the model, and then changed to fine tune it for sentiment analysis.

- **Goal**: Implement and experiment with transformers, for pretraining and fine tuning
- **Key Topics**: Transformer, Encoder, Transfer Learning


### Future Labs
Further TPs will cover other advanced AI topics for text and graph data.
